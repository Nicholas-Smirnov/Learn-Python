# Learn Basic Python

Hello everybody! It is Nick, and in these tutorials, you will be learning the basic aspects of python! 
**Python** is the most widely used programming language, and it is used in many different ways, from creating discord bots, to creating simple video games.
What makes python such a widely used language is the simplicity of the language, and I am here to teach you it!

# How This Will Work

The different lessons will be split into **branches**.
Just in case if you might not know what branches are, branches are shown above this readme file. Currently, the branch that we are in is called "Introduction". In order to change to another lesson, click on the branch, and then a dropdown will appear. Choose the next lesson, and then start learning! This is all that you have to know!

#Getting Started

First, you will actually need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). In other words, where will you be programming? Here are a couple recommendations that I have for you.

### Spyder 

Spyder is an IDE that will have to be downloaded. Spyder is relatively simple to use, and you can find the link [here][https://www.spyder-ide.org/]. However, if your computer has problems with storage, the next choice might be just for you.

### Replit.com

Replit.com is an online IDE that is really easy to use. Unlike spyder, it doesn't need to be downloaded. The link to the website can be found [here][https://replit.com/~].

### Visual Studio Code

Although VSC is not made specifically for python, it is a great IDE for almost all programming languages. It is very easy to use and it is very fun to use too! Visual Studio Code can be found [here][https://code.visualstudio.com/]

Have fun learning!
