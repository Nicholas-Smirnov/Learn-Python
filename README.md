# Objects Types

### What are objects?

In Python, **objects** are "things", and we work with these things. These things vary from numbers, to words. There are many different types of objects, and the most basic ones are listed later on.

### Object Types

* **String** - An object that is surrounded by quotation marks.
  * Examples of a string include:
    * 'Hello!'
    * "How are you?"
    * '''I am doing amazing! '''

* **Integer** - An object that is expressed as a whole number.
  * Examples of an integer include:
    * 123
    * 1000
    * 2352342

* **Float** - An object that is expressed as a number with a decimal.
  * Examples of a float include:
    * 10.1
    * 100.001
    * 13.0

* **Boolean** - An object that is expressed as either True or false.
  * Examples of a boolean include:
    * True
    * False

### What is Printing?

In Python, printing is not physically printing out a sheet of paper, it rather outputting information to the console. An example of how to print is like so:

```python

print("Hello world!")

```

Console Output:

```

Hello world!

```

### Can I Check What Objects I Am Printing?

Yes, you actually can! In Python, there is a built in function called **type()**. The defenition of function will be explained in a later lesson, but this is how to basically use the type function.

```python

print(type("Hello world!"))

```

Console Output:

```

<class 'str'>

```
